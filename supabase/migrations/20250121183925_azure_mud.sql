  # Update finance data RLS policies

  1. Changes
    - Modify RLS policies to allow server operations
    - Add username-based security instead of auth.uid()
    
  2. Security
    - Data is still protected by username
    - Each user can only access their own data
    - Server can perform operations with valid username
